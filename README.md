### Actual python tutorial
##### Basic guide on how to run python programs
- First download [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/)
- Download some text editor [atom](https://atom.io/), [sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or [pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (i use the first one but u can pick whatever u like)
- Learn how to use the terminal a bit ^
- Make a folder and in that folder make a file called `hello.py`
- Open that file up in your text editor and type `print("hello")`
- Save that file then go to your terminal and navigate to that folder the file is saved in (hint use the `cd` command to navigate folders)
- Now in the terminal type `python hello.py` and hit enter and you should see a line that says `hello`
- TLDR save your code into a file and run it by typing `python __filename__.py` in terminal
